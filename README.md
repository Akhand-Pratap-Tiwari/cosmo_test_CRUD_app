# cosmo_test_app

Simple CRUD app using CosmoCloud service.

## [Demo Video Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_fBFUvrlwYPnarLiLpjvQM5ccP8BRgca/view?usp=drivesdk)

## Getting Started

This project demonstrates the use of Cosmocloud API to build a simple app for CRUD operations.

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running the demo
In order to run the demo app just download and install `app-release.apk` from the `main` branch.

## Testing and setting up local environment
- First you need to install Flutter and dart. Follow the aforementioned article to do so.
- Next set up the [CosmoCloud APIs and MongoDB](https://docs.cosmocloud.io/getting-started).
- For DB model on CosmoCloud use following json template
```
{
	"name": "STRING",
	"empId": "STRING",
	"addLine1": "STRING",
	"city": "STRING",
	"country": "STRING",
	"zipCode": "STRING",
	"contactMethod": "STRING",
	"contactValue": "STRING"
}
```
- Set up the models and APIs.
- In the `delete request model` add `{"id": "STRING"}` as request body.
- Now create a new folder `secs` in `lib`. Under `secs` create new file naming `secrets.dart` and put following in it:
```
const String projectid = "Your Project ID";
const String environmentId = "Your environment ID";
const String baseApiUrl = "Your base endpoint URL e.g.: https://tier-region-.cosmocloud.io/development/api/modelName";
const Map<String, String> defaultHeader = {
  "projectId": "Your Project ID",
  "environmentId": "Your environment ID"
};
```
- Now run `flutter pub get` in the cmd in project folder.
- Now create a new emulator on Android Studio or whatever VM you are using.
- Run `flutter devices` in cmd to check whether device is visible or not.
- Now run `flutter run -d "device name or id"` in cmd. You can also choose device from `Status Bar` and press `F5` on keyboard if you are using VS Code.
- This will run app in `debug mode`. To create release apk run `flutter build apk`. For different platforms command may vary.
```
